# Program 1

- In this program I learnt how to print using `Serial Wire Viewer` which is prints text to the console on the host.
- I know the readme looks bare thats because I noted down the steps or bullet points in another file which I wrote when I was going through that section of the course: [Steps](ARM Crotex Programming-US-4.md)
